# MESSENGER Boundary Adjacent Sampling
Scripts to create datasets - corresponding to reference bow shock crossings (from Philpott+ 2020) - of solar wind and magnetosheath samples and their features. 

These scripts endeavour to take a 10 minute long sample of the solar wind and magnetosheath, directly adjacent to every bow shock crossing interval. In some cases, there is not sufficient magnetosheath data to fill 10 minutes. In these cases, the maximum time window possible is sampled.
